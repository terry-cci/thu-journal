# Summer Sem. of Acad. Year 2023~2024

I arrived at the school on 2023-08-19, on which the HMT camp starts. Since this repo. was created on the day before the very first lecture of the first year, the camp had already ended long time ago.

## HMT Camp

- Date: 2023-08-19 ~ 2023-08-22

The first day was basically for you to settle down. The dorm. did not change after the camp, so it is okay for you to take all your things there on that day. But you will have to store them in your wardrobe, shelves or cupboard during the mil. training.

The mentors will be the ones who lead the whole camp. Teachers seldom join the activities. During the camp, you will mostly be getting familiar with the campus, where the classrooms and buildings are, and get to meet new friends.

The camp is parallel to the one for mainland students. Some of the schedule may be the same as theirs, but most recreational and team-building events are unique to us.

### Day 1

The check in time started from 08:00 to 18:00. I arrived at 09:30 and everything could be done in a relaxed pace. I had a whole day to settle down in my dorm. The student card was fetched and with that you can do anything as a THU student already.

At night, there was a class meeting (the class expired after the camp), where we designed the class flag and slogan.

### Day 2 ~ 4

You will have a couple of lectures every day, and some team-building games or activities ~~(such as ice-skating, which was exclusively for us, and we were told not to tell others)~~. Finally, we had to prepare a performance for the closing ceremony.

The whole camp was free and laid-back.

## Military Training

- Date: 2023-08-28 ~ 2023-09-15

~~**_HELL NO_**~~

The mil. training spans nearly 3 weeks. The schedule was as below,

- **06:30 ~ 07:00** - occasional morning exersice, once or twice a week
- **07:00 ~ 07:30** - tidy up your room, the mentors will be the one to check it ~~(not every day, but sudden checks do exist)~~
- **07:30** - breakfast
- **about 07:45** - assemble and troop to the fields (we were in 紫籃 and 紫操)
- **08:00 ~ 12:00** - training or lectures
- **12:00** - lunch, often enough time to take a nap at dorm. after lunch
- **between 13:00 to 14:30** (depends on whether it is a lecture or a training) - assemble and trooping
- **? ~ 18:00** - training or lectures
- **18:00** - dinner
- **about 18:45** - sometimes muster and have night trainings, especially in the first week
- **around 21:00** - disassemble

There were 3 breaks during every training session, the second of which were longer ones. Students could perform during the breaks (singing, dancing or whatever entertains). Also, there were a few times that society members, class teachers or mentors buy us drinks and food.

Every faculty (or multiple if there were few people) will be formed into a company(連), every company contains 4 platoon(排).

### Lectures

Lectures were given almost every day during the first two weeks. The exam is an open book one, so printed materials were precious. Sleeping during the lectures does not really affect much ~~(I did sleep a whole lecture once)~~.

### The First Week

The first week was the most tough, sergeants were strict. You have to stay focused and concentrated. **The great march** was conducted at the first saturday night, starting from 24:00 to about 28:00. ~~It rained and everything was a mess. The ones who had to go to the toilet was told to do it in the trees on the riverside. **_HELLL_**~~

### The Second and Third Week

The strictness of the sergeants decreases as time goes by. A few exams were conducted during the second week. As the training gets nearer and nearer to its end, we focused more on the practice for the final parade ceremony.
