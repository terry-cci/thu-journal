## Comments

I'm so dead. should have spent more time on the subject. very hard for me due to the far behind international class last semester. although the exam was kind of similar with the given past papers, tons of calculation was needed. GG.

Choosing 徐帆 gives us model ans of hw every week before ddl, very recommended.
