# thu-journal
The repository serves as a journal of my university life in THU, majoring in computer science and technology.

## Preface
I was admitted to THU through recommendation in 2023, majoring in computer science and technology. Inspired by the repository of [@boxworld18](https://www.github.com/boxworld18) '[thu-cst-adventure](https://github.com/boxworld18/thu-cst-adventure)', I decided to make my own one too.
